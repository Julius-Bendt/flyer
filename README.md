# Flyer

## Description:
Flyer was developed in 2019, while I was travling to Norway from Denmark. The point of the game was that the player would have limited ammo, and rather than just shoot everything that moves, should "plan" to get a streak, and thus getting a better score.  

This project is dead. I wont be updating or maintaining it.
The code in the project does not follow my current style of coding, or up to any standards.
the code is in other words, spaghetti code and properly filled with bugs. 

## Warning:
Some assets have been removed, and others haven't been updated. This could result in a lot of errors!
Sprite shatter, a paid asset have been removed, giving some weird graphical issues. 

## Setup:
Either clone the reposity, or import the unity package file.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work. 


Made with :heart: in Aalborg, Denmark
